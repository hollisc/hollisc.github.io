= Deploying BlueCompute into OpenShift
:doctype: book

This https://github.ibm.com/CASE-DevOps-GSE/DevOps/blob/master/bluecompute-ce/README.md[README] provides the minimal steps to deploy the BlueCompute application into an OpenShift cluster without any persistent storage.  This is intentional to provide a quick starting point with a sample application.

For more detailed information on BlueCompute application, refer to the https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/spring/docs/openshift/README.md[IBM Cloud Native Microservice Application] Github repository.

For more detailed information on how the BlueCompute YAMLs were generated from existing HELM charts, refer to this https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes/blob/spring/docs/openshift/README.md#deploy-bluecompute-to-openshift[README].

== Requirements:

* A deployed OpenShift cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI `oc`.
* Install the Kubernetes CLI `kubectl`.

== Deploy BlueCompute

. Create a new project called `bluecompute`.  This will also set the context of your `oc` and `kubectl` CLI to use this project/namespace so you do not need to specify the namespace when running CLI commands.
+
----
oc new-project bluecompute
----

. Add Security Context Constraints (SCC) to the `default` Service Account
+
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:bluecompute:default
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:bluecompute:default
----

. Deploy BlueCompute
+
----
git clone git@github.ibm.com:CASE-DevOps-GSE/DevOps.git
cd DevOps
cd bluecompute-ce
oc apply --recursive --filename bluecompute-os
----

. Verify deployment is successful
```
+
= Check status of the pods.  The full deployment will take ~ 20 minutes.
+
oc get pods -w

= Expose the web application externally

oc expose svc web

= Retrieve the URL for the BlueCompute application.

= If you are using a Managed OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud, the URL will be similar to:

= (web-bluecompute.+++<cluster name="">+++-ibm-+++<unique key="">+++.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud).+++</unique>++++++</cluster>+++

oc get route

----

Once all the pods are up and running, you should see something similar to below by running `oc get po`.
You can ignore the pods with Error status.
